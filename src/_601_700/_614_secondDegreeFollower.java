		In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.
	
		Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.
	
		For example:
	
		+-------------+------------+
		| followee    | follower   |
		+-------------+------------+
		|     A       |     B      |
		|     B       |     C      |
		|     B       |     D      |
		|     D       |     E      |
		+-------------+------------+
		should output:
		+-------------+------------+
		| follower    | num        |
		+-------------+------------+
		|     B       |  2         |
		|     D       |  1         |
		+-------------+------------+
		Explaination:
		Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
		Note:
		Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
		Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.
